# Code-challenge-3-Flatdango

# Description 

Flatiron Movie Theater is open for business! You will be building out an
application, Flatdango, that allows a user to purchase movie tickets from the
theater.

As a user, I can:

1. See the first movie's details, including its **poster, title, runtime,
   showtime, and available tickets** when the page loads. The number of
   available tickets will need to be derived by subtracting the number of
   `tickets_sold` from the theater's `capacity`. You will need to make a GET
   request to the following endpoint to retrieve the film data:

   
   GET /films/1

   Example Response:
   {
     "id": "1",
     "title": "The Giant Gila Monster",
     "runtime": "108",
     "capacity": 30,
     "showtime": "04:00PM",
     "tickets_sold": 27,
     "description": "A giant lizard terrorizes a rural Texas community and a heroic teenager attempts to destroy the creature.",
     "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/2157/p2157_v_v8_ab.jpg"
   }
 
2. See a menu of all movies on the left side of the page in the `ul#films`
   element when the page loads. (_optional_: you can style each film in the list
   by adding the classes `film item` to each `li` element.) There is a
   placeholder `li` in the `ul#films` element that is hardcoded in the HTML â€”
   feel free to remove that element by editing the HTML file directly, or use
   JavaScript to remove the placeholder element before populating the list. You
   will need to make a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve the
   film data:


   GET /films

   Example response:
   [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "title": "The Giant Gila Monster",
        "runtime": "108",
        "capacity": 30,
        "showtime": "04:00PM",
        "tickets_sold": 27,
        "description": "A giant lizard terrorizes a rural Texas community and a heroic teenager attempts to destroy the creature.",
        "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/2157/p2157_v_v8_ab.jpg"
      },
      {
        "id": "2",
        "title": "Manos: The Hands Of Fate",
        "runtime": "118",
        "capacity": 50,
        "showtime": "06:45PM",
        "tickets_sold": 44,
        "description": "A family gets lost on the road and stumbles upon a hidden, underground, devil-worshiping cult led by the fearsome Master and his servant Torgo.",
        "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/47781/p47781_v_v8_ac.jpg"
      }
   ]

3. Buy a ticket for a movie. After clicking the "Buy Ticket" button, I should
   see the number of available tickets decreasing on the frontend. I should not
   be able to buy a ticket if the showing is sold out (if there are 0 tickets
   available). **No persistence is needed for this feature**.
   
   
## Bonus deliverables

1. Click on a movie in the menu to replace the currently displayed movie's
   details with the new movie's details. Note that you may have to make an
   additional GET request to access the movie's details.

2. When a movie is sold out (when there are no available tickets remaining),
   indicate that the movie is sold out by changing the button text to "Sold
   Out". Also update the film item in the `ul#films` menu by adding a class of
   `sold-out` to the film. For reference, here's what the contents of the
   `ul#films` element should look like with a sold out film:

   ```html
   <li class="film item">(Title of film)</li>
   <li class="sold-out film item">(Title of a sold-out film)</li>
   <li class="film item">(Title of film)</div>
   ```

## Extra Bonus deliverables

1. When a ticket is purchased, persist the updated number of `tickets_sold` on
   the server. Remember, the frontend shows the number of available tickets
   based on the `tickets_sold` and the `capacity`, so only the `tickets_sold`
   should be updated on the backend when a ticket is purchased. You will need to
   make a request that follows this structure:

   ```txt
   PATCH /films/:id

   Request Headers: {
     Content-Type: application/json
   }

   Request Body: {
     "tickets_sold": 28
   }
   ----
   Example Response:
   {
      "id": "1",
      "title": "The Giant Gila Monster",
      "runtime": "108",
      "capacity": 30,
      "showtime": "04:00PM",
      "tickets_sold": 28,
      "description": "A giant lizard terrorizes a rural Texas community and a heroic teenager attempts to destroy the creature.",
      "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/2157/p2157_v_v8_ab.jpg"
   }
   ```
2. Delete a film from the server. Add a delete button next to each film in the
   `ul#films` menu. When the button is clicked, remove the film from the list
   and also delete the film on the server:

   ```txt
   DELETE /films/:id

   Example Response:
   {}
   ```
